# DansDeals

Welcome to my DansDeals gem.

This gem scrapes dansdeals.com for new deals and prints the deal information to the console.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dansdeals'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dansdeals

## Usage

Run the gem and the program will print the first 5 deals from the dansdeals.com homepage.
You can then type the number of the deal you want to read more about and the terminal will display the full text of the deal.
You can also type "List" to display the list of deals again, "Next" to see the next 5 deals, and "Previous" to go back to the last 5 deals.
When you are done type "Exit" to leave the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
